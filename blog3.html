            <p class="paragraph-detials-large"><strong>On January 5, 2024, Boeing and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) witnessed a groundbreaking event during the IIT Boeing National Aeromodelling competition.</strong> The competition, held at the IITDM campus, saw the participation of college students showcasing their skills in aero modelling. <strong>What made this event truly historic was the inclusion of groups of school students who not only competed but also gave tough competition to their college counterparts.<br><br>The team named &quot;Greats&quot; comprised four talented girls from a government school under the Adi Dravidar Welfare Board (ADW).</strong> Fathima M led the team, with members Reshmi M, Siva Asika, and Rajeswari P. Remarkably, this enthusiastic team secured the third position in the national-level competition and eagerly prepared for the finals in Bengaluru scheduled for the first quarter of the year.<br>‍<strong>The significance of this event lies in its departure from the traditional practice, where only students from premier institutes participated.</strong> The organizers and competitors were astonished to see school students as applicants, challenging the norms that had been prevalent for years. <strong>Dr. Sureskkumar Namasivayam, an innovator, passionate teacher, social entrepreneur, and visionary, played a pivotal role in guiding and mentoring these government school students. He firmly believes and advocates that the best minds can emerge not only from elite institutes but also from government schools. </strong>This year&#x27;s competition not only marked a historic moment but also opened up new opportunities and challenged established norms.<br><br>Let me guide you through the journey that commenced in November 2023. At that time, Hon. Anand I.A.S, the director of the Adi Dravidar Welfare Board, approved a groundbreaking project to open up opportunities for school students <strong>under the training of the 360 Flying Club and the purview of the board. Beginning as a pilot run, the project identified 25 ADWB schools across three districts in Tamil Nadu—Chennai, Kanchipuram, and Chengalpattu. </strong>The primary focus was on students in grades 9th and 11th in higher secondary schools, while students in grades 9th and 10th were given a unique opportunity in high schools.<br><br>‍<strong>In a mere 13 days, a whirlwind of activity unfolded as organizers embarked on a mission to spread awareness, and recruit, and train students for a high-stakes competition. The urgency of the timeline was heightened by the need to sort through a staggering 2033 students in multiple selection procedures, aiming to identify the most promising 20 participants.</strong> However, the swift process faced an unforeseen challenge when the onset of Chennai rains delayed the practice sessions.<br><br>Undeterred by the setbacks, the organizers initiated an intensive training program for the selected students. The focus extended beyond conventional methods, encompassing the intricate tasks of designing and constructing a plane capable of soaring to success in the impending competition. This condensed timeline demandedunparalleled dedication and collaboration as the students raced against time to not only grasp the complexities of aeromodelling but also to fine-tune their skills for the ultimate challenge. The culmination of these efforts was encapsulated in the abstract they submitted, showcasing their determination to excel despite the formidable time constraints. <strong>The journey from recruitment to competition readiness exemplified resilience, adaptability, and a shared commitment to surmounting obstacles in pursuit of excellence.<br>‍</strong>In the exhilarating journey through the finals qualifier and mains at the Zonal level, our remarkable team, the GREATS, emerged as proud achievers. Comprising exclusively of talented young girls, this dynamic team clinched the Bronze medal, showcasing their exceptional skills and dedication in the fiercely competitive arena. <br>‍<strong>The victory not only underlines their prowess in aeromodelling but also stands as a testament to their resilience and collaborative spirit. </strong>The GREATS have not only made their mark in the competition but have become an inspiration, breaking barriers and challenging stereotypes in the world of aeronautical innovation. <strong>The GREATS have emerged as a beacon of hope and idols to aspiring young minds and government school students in Tamil Nadu and India.</strong></p><img src="images/hUZn2teamgreats360fc.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="images/hUZn2teamgreats360fc-p-500.png 500w, images/hUZn2teamgreats360fc.png 540w" alt="">
